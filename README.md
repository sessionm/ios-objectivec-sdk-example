SessionMSDKExample
==================
Sample project showing how to use the SessionM SDK. 

This project takes advantage of cocoapods (http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for the sake of importing the SessionM SDK.

If you do not use cocoapods in your project, download the SessionM SDK (https://content.sessionm.com/1/86/b/4782879/SessionM_iOS_v1.11.7_Release.zip) and be sure to link against the following frameworks: AVFoundation, EventKit, EventKitUI, CoreData, CoreMedia, MediaPlayer, AdSupport and StoreKit frameworks.
