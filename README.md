SessionMSDKExample
==================
Sample project showing how to use the SessionM SDK. 

This project takes advantage of cocoapods (http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) for the sake of importing the SessionM SDK.

If you do not use cocoapods in your project, download the SessionM SDK (http://www.sessionm.com/documentation/downloads.php), place the SessionM-SDK folder in your project, and be sure to link against the following frameworks: AVFoundation, EventKit, EventKitUI, CoreData, CoreMedia, MediaPlayer, AdSupport and StoreKit frameworks.
